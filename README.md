# Rhyming-Neural-Net
LSTM network created using Tensorflow and Keras frameworks.
For provided word, the net generates a rhyme with ~80% performance.
Best results were found by teaching the net with reversing the order of characters in words.
Run with run_net.py or run_net_rev.py script. Best model so far is 'modelL_50e_REV_lat480'.
